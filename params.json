{"name":"Unclebob","body":"# unclebob\r\n> Version 0.3.6\r\n\r\n# What\r\n\r\nUncleBob is a simple django app that allow you writting per-app tests within these paths:\r\n\r\n* `<appname>/tests/unit/test*.py` - for unit tests\r\n* `<appname>/tests/functional/test*.py` - for functional tests\r\n* `<appname>/tests/integration/test*.py` - for integration tests\r\n\r\n# installing\r\n\r\n## first of all\r\n\r\n    pip install unclebob\r\n\r\n## add it to your django project\r\n\r\non settings.py\r\n\r\n```python\r\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\r\n    ...\r\n    'unclebob',\r\n    ...\r\n)\r\n\r\nTEST_RUNNER = 'unclebob.runners.Nose\r\nimport unclebob\r\nunclebob.take_care_of_my_tests()\r\n```\r\n\r\n# running\r\n\r\njust use the regular **test** command:\r\n\r\n    python manage.py test\r\n\r\n## running only the unit tests\r\n\r\n    python manage.py test --unit\r\n\r\n## running only the functional tests\r\n\r\n    python manage.py test --functional\r\n\r\n## running only the integration tests\r\n\r\n    python manage.py test --integration\r\n\r\n\r\n## running only a specific path\r\n\r\n    python manage.py test path/to/app/tests\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    python manage.py test path/to/app/tests/unit\r\n\r\n# warning:\r\n\r\nif you run only the `unit` tests, then unclebob is NOT going to setup\r\nthe test database. Since\r\n[unit tests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) are supposed\r\nto be \"unwired\", what I mean is that unit tests MUST NOT make use of\r\nactual database, filesystem or network at all.\r\n\r\nInstead, they must test isolated parts of your code.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, sir, Uncle Bob is gonna break your neck in case you\r\ndecide to use those, so called, \"external resources\" in your unit\r\ntests.\r\n\r\n# although you can tell unclebob to never touch the database at all\r\n\r\nin your `settings.py`\r\n\r\n```python\r\nUNCLEBOB_NO_DATABASE = True\r\n```\r\n\r\n# other aspects\r\n\r\n## 1. it provides an environment variable, so that you'll know when unclebob is running\r\n\r\nWhen unclebob is running tests, it sets the environment variable\r\n `UNCLEBOB_RUNNING` to the current working directory.\r\n\r\nYou can use it, for example, in your codebase fr avoiding logging\r\nduring the tests.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\n[nose](http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/) is such a really nice\r\ntool for writting tests on python.\r\n\r\nInstead of using the unittest framework, which is builtin python thou\r\nis less fun to use.\r\n\r\nAnd you know, the most joyable is the writting/running test\r\nexperience, more developers will write tests for the project. And as\r\nmuch tests, better.\r\n\r\n# Naming\r\n\r\nThis project was named after [Uncle Bob Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin),\r\none of the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) chaps that\r\nbrought code cleaness techniques and advices to the rest of us.\r\n","tagline":"django tool for running tests organized between unit, functional and integration","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
